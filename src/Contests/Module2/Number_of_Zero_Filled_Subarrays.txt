Problem Statement

Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays

You are given an integer array nums, and the task is to determine the number of subarrays within the given array that are filled entirely with zeros. A subarray is defined as a contiguous and non-empty sequence of elements within the array.
Input:
nums: A non-empty integer array of length n (1 <= n <= 10^5).
Each element of the array nums is an integer.
The integers in the array nums can be positive, negative, or zero.
Output:
The output should be a single integer, representing the total number of subarrays in nums that consist of only zeros.

Example

INPUT
[1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
OUTPUT
6
